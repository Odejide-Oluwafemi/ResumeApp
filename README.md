# resume_app
ResumeApp is a resume viewer. It basically is a mobile-version of a Resume with minimalist animation and an auto dark mode switching feature.

It was built with Flutter/Dart. In Portrait view, there are 2 screens which hold the 2 pages in the app: The Overview Page that shows just the Users' Image, Name and JobTitle and the Details Page that lays out the Users' details in Cards, grouped into Sections. In Landscape View, both pages (Overview and Details Page) are laid out side-by-side in one screen.

The Codebase has models which hold specific User Information with the UserModel being the overall class that holds other model classes which include: ExperienceModel (information about past work experiences and projects involved in),
ContactModel (contact information and URL),
SkillModel (information about soft skills and tech skills),

The url_launcher library was just to implement opening of URLs in the Contact Section which links to the Users' Personal Contact Information.

With more time, would have Implemented:
  A Template selection feature that changes the layout of the App accordingly,
  Authentication so users can log in and, those with Premium access, will have access to more defined templates.
  Ability to Save and Download the Resume in pdf format.
  General Improvement on the UI and feel with more cooked Animations.
